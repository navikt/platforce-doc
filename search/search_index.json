BA Business Analyst Business Analysts are the people in your organization who are asking \u2018why\u2019 (why a process happens the way it does) to understand what the business needs from its technology. As an organization grows, it typically demands larger and more complex software solutions. That's where BAs come in. BSS Business Support System \"Solutions which streamline operations, reduce costs, and help businesses create more innovative products by centralizing customer data and automating processes.\" (source) DF Dreamforce Dreamforce is Salesforce's flagship conference - but a conference like no other! Tickets to this annual event are highly sought-after because of the learning and networking opportunities available to the 170,000+ attendees (not to mention the legendary parties, too!) FKA Formerly Known As Due to the name changes Salesforce has made to some products, these three letters have started to creep into our vocabulary to avoid confusion, bringing the person we're speaking to along with us. EE Enterprise Edition You will commonly hear these Salesforce editions: Professional, Enterprise, and Unlimited. Enterprise Edition (EE) is where most organizations opt to start from, where you gain access to the features that most organizations need. GA General Availability The release status where a feature has been formally released. This happens by its inclusion in a Salesforce release cycle (Spring, Summer, Winter). Support will be available as technical support teams have been briefed on the functionality. (It comes after the Pilot and Beta phases). IaaS Infrastructure as a Service \"Self-service models for accessing, monitoring, and managing remote datacenter infrastructures, such as compute (virtualized or bare metal), storage, networking, and networking services (e.g. firewalls). Salesforce does not offer Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) services. It is a customer of them, primarily Amazon Web Services.\" (source) KPI Key Performance Indicator \"A Key Performance Indicator is a measurable value that demonstrates how effectively a company is achieving key business objectives.\" (source) LEX Lightning Experience Salesforce revamped the product interface around 2015 after having a relatively consistent look and feel for its 16 years in operation. Salesforce Lightning was designed to be a big improvement in user experience \u2013 to boost user productivity and make CRM a pleasure to use. Most organizations have now transitioned to Salesforce Lightning from Classic. LOB Line of Business Line of Business could often come up when planning Salesforce projects. For example, Sales, Marketing, etc. When it comes to packaging, you can either split by project (let's say Quote to Cash broadly) or by LOB. PaaS Platform as a Service \"A set of cloud-based services that enable business users and developers to build applications at speed...As it\u2019s a cloud-based service there\u2019s no need to worry about the set-up and maintenance of servers, patching, upgrades, authentication.\" (source) Salesforce characteristics that make it PaaS include a Mobile Software Development Kit (SDK), managed cloud database, and point-and-click app building. PE Professional Edition You will commonly hear these Salesforce editions: Professional, Enterprise, and Unlimited. QA Quality Assurance QA is a stage of testing/test automation, which is essential to manage risk and deliver quality Salesforce releases on time. The quality of any Salesforce customizations is your responsibility \u2013 not Salesforce's! QA teams will stress-test the system's functionality and report any bugs that need to be resolved. ROI Return on Investment As the name suggests, this is the return (the revenue) that an organization has gained as a direct result of an investment (budget spent). This is heard in the Salesforce ecosystem in multiple contexts \u2013 it could be an investment into a new Salesforce product, enhancement project, or AppExchange app. It could be RevOps teams performing ROI reporting across their marketing and sales data. SaaS Software as a Service Salesforce set out to be SaaS through and through! A third-party provider, like Salesforce, hosts your CRM and related applications for your users to access over the internet. In the case of Salesforce, licenses to access the service are typically billed annually, with a contractual commitment of one to three years. That's why SaaS was revolutionary in the beginning, as companies were no longer locked into one system, with the possibility to switch providers without investing in the IT infrastructure themselves! SLDC Software Development Lifecycle \"A process that produces software with the highest quality and lowest cost in the shortest time possible.\" (source) SFDC Salesforce dot com Salesforce pioneered cloud CRM, so it was always referred to as 'Salesforce dot-com' in the early days to emphasise its online accessibility and to distinguish itself from premise offerings. The acronym still sticks today, especially among serving community members. SLACK Searchable Log of All Communication and Knowledge This might seem like a strange entry on this list, but Salesforce\u2019s workplace instant messaging/collaboration platform is, in fact, an acronym, standing for \u201cSearchable Log of All Communication and Knowledge\u201d. SME Subject Matter Expert This is an individual with specialized knowledge in a specific area. In the Salesforce ecosystem, you will find individuals with a depth of knowledge in a niche area that makes them indispensable to a particular business model or project. TBID Trailblazer ID Trailblazer ID is how someone authenticates (i.e. logs in to access) Salesforce digital experiences \u2013 think Trailhead, Salesforce Events, Salesforce Help (documentation), Trailblazer Community, Salesforce+, developer.salesforce.com, and the rest of the 25+ other experiences. Practically speaking, this is a single sign-up and sign-on experience that will enable you to keep your profile and settings with you, no matter which digital experience you\u2019re using or wherever your career takes you (for example, if you change jobs). /u/m Per user, per month There are multiple different types of Salesforce licenses, most of which Salesforce bill your organization for the number of users by month that take advantage of the services they provide. You may see this abbreviation on Salesforce's website pricing pages, on contracts, etc. UAT User Acceptance Testing User acceptance testing is the final testing stage in software development before production. It\u2019s used to get feedback from users who test the software and its user interface (UI). UAT is usually done manually, with users creating real-world situations and testing how the software reacts and performs. Test-case scenarios can also be automated, simulating a user experience. (source) UE Unlimited Edition You will commonly hear these Salesforce editions: Professional, Enterprise, and Unlimited. Unlimited edition (UE) gives you access to the best in the suite. UI User Interface \"User interface (UI) is the point of human-computer interaction and communication in a device. This can include display screens, keyboards, a mouse and the appearance of a desktop.\" (source).
