Language","text":"<p>Configurable metadata (such as Custom Objects, Custom Fields, Process Builder, Flows, Apex, etc.) is created and named in the English language. This applies to both labels, API names, and help text. For metadata where labels are visible to the user, these must be translated to Norwegian using the Translation Workbench. There are two main reasons for this approach:</p> <ol> <li>We want to adhere to English names at the database and backend level. This enhances the flow and readability of code, especially since English is already extensively used in standard functions and external libraries.</li> <li>External interfaces will face requirements to support multiple languages.
