## Navigating the Shared Responsibility Model: Our Role in Salesforce Security

### What Is the Shared Responsibility Model?

At NAV, we rely on Salesforce to manage our critical data and processes. The Shared Responsibility Model outlines how both Salesforce and we, as customers, contribute to safeguarding our information.

1. **Salesforce’s Commitment:**
    - Salesforce provides a robust foundation:
        - Infrastructure Security: They build and maintain secure data centers.
        - Encryption: Data in transit and at rest is encrypted.
        - Monitoring and Compliance: Continuous vigilance against threats.
    - They equip us with tools and guidelines to enhance security.

2. **Our Role:**
    - We’re not passive recipients; we actively participate:
        - Configuration: Customize security settings to align with our needs.
        - User Access Management: Control permissions and roles.
        - Data Governance: Define retention policies and manage data lifecycle.
        - Education: Train our team to recognize risks.
        - Incident Response: Be prepared to act swiftly.
