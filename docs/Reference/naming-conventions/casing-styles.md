# Casing Styles

When it comes to naming conventions, various casing styles exist. Let's explore the differences between them:

## Snake Case

- In snake case, words are separated by underscores (```_```).
- All letters are in lowercase.
- **Examples:**

    - `number_of_users = 34`
    - `hello_phrase = "Hello World"`

## Screaming Snake Case

- This variant of snake case uses all uppercase letters.
- Also known as the "screaming snake case."
- **Examples:**

    - `NUMBER_OF_USERS = 34`
    - `HELLO_PHRASE = "Hello World"`

## Kebab Case

- Similar to snake case, but words are separated by dashes (```-```).
- All words are lowercase.
- Kebab case is a human-readable way to combine multiple words into a single identifier.
- **Examples:**

    - `number-of-users = 34`
    - `hello-phrase = "Hello World"`

## Camel Case

- In camel case, the first word starts with a lowercase letter.
- Each subsequent word begins with an uppercase letter.
- **Examples:**

    - `numberOfUsers = 34`
    - `helloPhrase = "Hello World"`

## Pascal Case

- Similar to camel case, but the first letter of the first word is also capitalized.
- Every word starts with an uppercase letter.
- **Examples:**

    - `NumberOfUsers = 34`
    - `HelloPhrase = "Hello World"`

Choose the appropriate casing style based on your programming language and coding conventions! ðŸš€
