# Linting
When it comes to linting we use various tools. This reference is based on how it's setup in the Platforce owned repositories.

Some of the CI jobs have linter checks in place that also validates in reference to security etc.

Today we currently use Salesforce Code Analyzer, Prettier and Eslint.
Example setup can be seen here <https://github.com/navikt/crm-platform-base>
